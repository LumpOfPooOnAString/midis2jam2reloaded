/**
 * Fretted instruments in M2J2 are composed of several parts:
 *
 *  * Upper strings - These are the strings you see when a string is not being played.
 *  * Lower strings - These are the wobbly, animated strings you see when a string is being played.
 *  * Note finger - The small, yellow dot that hides the seam between upper and lower strings
 *
 * When a note on a string is to be played, the upper string scales by a factor x, and the bottom string scales
 * by a factor 1 - x. This way, they meet at the correct spot on the fretboard. At that position, the note finger
 * is placed to hide the seam between the upper and lower strings.
